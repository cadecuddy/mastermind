# Mastermind
Rome wasn't built in a day, but this version of the [popular 1970s code breaking game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) of the same name sure was. I was playing this game on thanksgiving with family and did my best at recreating it that same day.

Instructions on how to play are on the game, which you can find [here](https://main.d21udxm8rad8sx.amplifyapp.com/)
